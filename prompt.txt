this is a decodable text format, for literacy teaching, emphasizing pronunciation. Your task is to extract the text from that image into html tags format. Please follow these rules:
1: keep the decodable text format, making sure it's got the proper formatting (diacritical marks, font size)
2: remove the underline
3: remove the superscript numbers
4: return only the content of the html body








rule1: keep the info of what sentences are being underlined, make sure every underlined sentence in the image should be represented as underlined in the html
rule2: keep diacritical marks of each one of the letters, make sure that letters without diacritical marks won't be represented as such
rule3: the size of the letters matter, so if a letter has smaller font-size it should be represented as such, make sure all other letters are in normal size
rule4: 










example: the title of the text should be like: <u>p</u>ā<small>i</small>nt that nōs<small>e</small></u>






Result looks really good. Notice that some letter are smaller than the others, in this case use small html tag to keep the format. Please update the previous prompt with the new instruction and keep the same image as reference
